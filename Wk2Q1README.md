A description of the problem and a discussion of the background. (15 marks)
Seattle is a commuter city with limited options for public transportation. Due to seismic activity, it is not practical to develop a subway system.  Therefore public transport is focused on buses and an expanding light rail network. Citizens of Seattle and the surrounding area are subject to an entire array of roadway conditions on their morning commute. They would benefit to know where the major accident roadways are situated and how the current conditions can affect their chance of bening in a minor or major accident.  
This project will develop a prediction model for the probability of having a roadway accident based upon the conditions of the roads and environment that can be observed in the morning hours. Users will be able to use this as a predictor of potential accidents based upon their normal commuting routes. With new advances in home work capability, they can use a prediction model to determine if they should decide to work from home for the day or commute into their offices for their respective engagements.

The target audience for this analysis are the greater Seattle commuters who need to travel to work in the region everyday. This population cares to know this information to be able to make more informed choices on commuting and public safety. By reducing commuter traffic on days with higher probability of accidents, the public received and addtional benefit of overall lower risk.
